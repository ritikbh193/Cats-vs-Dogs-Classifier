# Cats-vs-Dogs-Classifier
This project is a deep learning model built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images as either cats or dogs. The model is trained on labeled images and uses multiple convolutional layers to extract features, followed by fully connected layers for classification.
